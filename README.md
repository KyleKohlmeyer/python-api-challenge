# python-api-challenge
This repository contains code that uses the Open Weather API to  find the weather conditions at hundreds of cities and perform linear regression analysis using NumPy and SciPy to see if latitude and certain weather conditions are related. This code can be found in the WeatherPy ipynb file. Additionally, this repository contains code to parse through the city data of WeatherPy based on weather preferences, find hotels near the cities using the Geoapify API, and plot those cities on a map with the Geoviews library. This code can be found in the VacationPy ipynb file. The output file contains the plots for the linear regression analysis, as well as a CSV with the city and weather data produced from the WeatherPy code.
